# Changelog

Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org): major for a redesign or
removed pages, minor for new pages or features, patch for fixes and copy changes.
The version lives in `package.json` and in git tags (`v2.0.0`); it is not shown on the site.

Release with `npm version patch`, `npm version minor` or `npm version major`.
That bumps `package.json`, commits, and tags in one step.
